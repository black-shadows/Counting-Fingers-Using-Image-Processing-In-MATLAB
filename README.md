# Counting-Fingers-Using-Image-Processing-In-MATLAB
This project used Matlab and the Centre for Image Processing and Analysis VSG toolbox to count the number of fingers on a number of hands by using geometric isolation to cut off the palm, converting the picture to black and white and counting the resulting number of white strips (fingers).
